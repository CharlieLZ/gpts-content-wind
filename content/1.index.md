# What is GPTs?

"GPTs" refers to a new offering from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gptshttps://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) that allows individuals and businesses to create custom versions of the ChatGPT model:sparkles:.

These custom models can be tailored for specific purposes, such as aiding in education, assisting with work-related tasks, or enhancing daily life in various ways.


## Features

1. **Customization**: Individuals can customize their own version of ChatGPT with specific instructions, knowledge, and skills, without requiring coding knowledge.

2. **Use Cases**: GPTs can be created for personal use, for internal use within a company, or to be shared with the wider public.

3. **Ease of Creation**: Creating a GPT is designed to be as simple as having a conversation, where the creator can specify the abilities and knowledge of the GPT.

4. **Sharing and Monetization**: Users can share their GPTs publicly, and with the upcoming GPT Store, creators can potentially earn money based on the usage of their custom GPTs.

5. **Privacy and Safety Measures**: OpenAI has implemented privacy and safety measures to ensure that GPTs comply with usage policies, and users' data remains private.

6. **Integration with Real-world Data**: Developers can define custom actions for GPTs by integrating one or more APIs, allowing the GPTs to access external data or services.

7. **Enterprise Solutions**: Companies can create GPTs tailored to their business needs and deploy them internally, with control over how these GPTs are shared within the organization.
